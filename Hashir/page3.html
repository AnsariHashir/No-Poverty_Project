RuPay debit card

Accident insurance cover

Life insurance cover

Access to direct benefit transfers (DBT)

Overdraft facility (after maintaining the account properly)

PMJDY has helped millions of people—especially in rural and low-income families—become part of the formal banking system, promoting financial security, savings habits, and transparency in government welfare schemes.
