        <h2 style="color:#d4c714; margin-top:0;">Lack of education</h2>
        <p>
      Lack of education is one of the biggest causes of poverty because it limits a person’s ability to secure stable and well-paying employment. When individuals do not have access to proper schooling, they miss out on essential skills such as reading, writing, and problem-solving. This makes it difficult for them to compete in the job market, forcing them into low-income work that keeps them trapped in poverty. Over time, this also affects the next generation, as uneducated parents are less aware of opportunities for their children.

        <h2 style="color:#d4c714; margin-top:0;"> Unemployment</h2>
        <p>
       Unemployment contributes greatly to poverty because people without regular work have no reliable source of income. In many regions, job opportunities are limited or the available jobs pay very low wages. This makes it challenging for families to afford basic needs such as food, healthcare, and housing. Long-term unemployment also affects mental well-being and reduces a person’s confidence and productivity, further deepening poverty.

        <h2 style="color:#d4c714; margin-top:0;"> Economic Inequality
</h2>
        <p>
       Economic inequality widens the gap between the rich and the poor, creating an environment where only a small portion of society benefits from most of the wealth and resources. People from poorer backgrounds often have limited access to quality education, healthcare, and financial support. This inequality prevents them from improving their economic situation, causing poverty to continue from one generation to the next.
