        <h2 style="color:#26b85f; margin-top:0;">           Poor health and malnutrition</h2>
        <p>
      Poverty limits access to nutritious food, clean water, and healthcare services.
Children often suffer from stunted growth and weakened immunity.
Diseases spread easily in unhygienic living conditions.
Lack of medical treatment makes even minor illnesses dangerous.
Poor health means the body is not working properly due to illness, weakness, or lack of proper care. It affects daily activities like studying, working, or even basic tasks. Poor health can be caused by infections, dirty surroundings, lack of clean water, unhealthy lifestyle, or not getting medical care on time.

    <section style="padding:20px; margin:20px; background:white; border-radius:8px; box-shadow:0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
        <h2 style="color:#26b85f; margin-top:0;">  Lack of Education</h2>
        <p>
       Families in poverty cannot afford school fees, uniforms, or books.
Children often drop out to work and support the family.
This creates a cycle where low education leads to low-paying jobs.
As a result, poverty continues across generations.
Lack of education is a major barrier to personal and national development. When children do not receive proper schooling, they miss out on basic skills like reading, writing, and problem-solving. This limits their chances of getting good jobs in the future. As a result, poverty continues from one generation to the next. Education is the key that opens opportunities, and without it, growth becomes difficult.

        <h2 style="color:#26b85f; margin-top:0;">Unemployment and low income
</h2>
        <p>
       Economic inequality widens the gap between the rich and the poor, creating an environment where only a small portion of society benefits from most of the wealth and resources. People from poorer backgrounds often have limited access to quality education, healthcare, and financial support. This inequality prevents them from improving their economic situation, causing poverty to continue from one generation to the next.
